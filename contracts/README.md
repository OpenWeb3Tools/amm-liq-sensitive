Buidl in this order:

- [Separate && Equal] (Pool contracts hold assets + logic & all assets are equally weighted in the pool)
- [Separate && Offset] (Pool contracts hold assets + logic & all assets can be set to have different weights in the pool)
- [Combined && Offset] (Pool contracts hold _only_ logic, assets are held in a single 'combined collateral' contract & all assets can be set to have different weights in the pool)
