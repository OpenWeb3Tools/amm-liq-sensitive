'Equal' pools are like an auto-balancing index fund where every asset in the pool is equally balanced in value.
When a pool reaches stasis with no arbitrage opportunities present, each asset in the pool should be of equal value.

i.e.
- SPARTA:WBNB -> 50% SPARTA : 50% WBNB (50/50)
- SPARTA:WBNB:BUSD:USDT -> 25% SPARTA : 25% WBNB : 25% BUSD : 25% USDT (25/25/25/25)
